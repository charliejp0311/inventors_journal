search box on the show page for all inventions
form on index page
form will query database for "whats in the search box"
return matches

I added a form that sent a get request with a query field back to the index page.  
I did this for the category page as well as the individual inventors pages. 

**clean up code to make it more DRY**
**separation of concerns--- move problems and solutions to individual controllers**

I removed as many redundant calls like @user = current user in the controller 
when I can call that from the view as well.  I moved both problems and solutions activities
to their own controller.  I fixed the scope methods and added one for the search function.
